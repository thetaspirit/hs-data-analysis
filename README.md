# Data Analysis Project

I worked on this project during the summer of 2020 with the guidance of [Professor Tze Meng Low](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/low-tze-meng.html) at CMU.
I chose to analyze data from a public dataset of interactions between high schoolers throughout a week.
See the [data set's README](https://github.com/thetaspirit/hs-data-analysis/blob/master/data/original/README.txt) for more information about it.

* Check out the [poster](https://github.com/thetaspirit/hs-data-analysis/blob/master/Poster.pdf) I made for a summary of my conclusions that I drew from analyzing the data set.
* TODO: add some notebooks of interest for ppl to look at
